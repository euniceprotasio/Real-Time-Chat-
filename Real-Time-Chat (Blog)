INTRODUCTION
Real-time communication has become an essential component of many applications in today's fast-paced digital era.
Real-time chat functionality is in high demand, whether in collaboration tools, customer service systems, or social networking platforms. 
In this blog post, we'll look at how to create a real-time chat application with Python, a powerful and widely used programming language.

SOCKET CONNECTION 
The script uses Python's socket library to establish a connection between the client and a server. 
The socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) creates a socket object, specifying the use of IPv4 addresses (AF_INET) 
and TCP packets for communication (SOCK_STREAM).
The connect function attempts to connect to the server using the provided host address (HOST) and port number (PORT). 
If successful, a message is printed to the console and displayed in the chat window. If unsuccessful, an error message is shown to the user.
